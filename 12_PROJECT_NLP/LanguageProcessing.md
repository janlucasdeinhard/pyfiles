# NLP Projects
This directory contains all files related to Natural Language Processing. I broadly classify them into the following sub-domains:
* Channel Precoding
  Based on my Communications Engineering background, this is the attempt to build a channel precoder based on machine learning methods which can achieve similar or better
  performance than classical precoding methods, such as channel estimation and inversion.
* Internet Crawler
  This is the attempt to contruct a class which can traverse the online space independently and perform tasks. This is intended to give any machine learning algorithm a generic
  transport vehicle.
* Recognizing Writing Styles
  The different writing styles of distinct authors should enable a neural network with corresponding training to differentiate between them, or to establish authenticity of 
  authorship.
* Seq To Seq Model
  Attempt to implement a simple SeqToSeq model, for multiple purposes.
* Testing Pretrained Models
  Used for pretrained model tests, for integration with other projects. Currently only BERT.
* Tweet Bot
  Goal of this project is to construct a bot which can synthesize Tweets which sound plausible. This is a downgraded version of building a machine to pass the Turing test.
