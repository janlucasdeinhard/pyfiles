       " <p class=\"p\">In the previous chapters we have been studying the mechanics\n",
       " of points, or small particles whose internal structure does not concern\n",
       " us. For the next few chapters we shall study the application of\n",
       " Newton’s laws to more complicated\n",
       " things. When the world becomes more complicated, it also becomes more\n",
       " interesting, and we shall find that the phenomena associated with the\n",
       " mechanics of a more complex object than just a point are really quite\n",
       " striking. Of course these phenomena involve nothing but combinations of\n",
       " Newton’s laws, but it is sometimes\n",
       " hard to believe that only $F = ma$ is at work.\n",
       " </p>,\n",
       " <p class=\"p\">The more complicated objects we deal with can be of several kinds:\n",
       " water flowing, galaxies whirling, and so on. The simplest\n",
       " “complicated” object to analyze, at the start, is what we call a\n",
       " <em class=\"emph\">rigid body</em>, a solid object that is turning as\n",
       " it moves about. However, even such a simple object may have a most\n",
       " complex motion, and we shall therefore first consider the simplest\n",
       " aspects of such motion, in which an extended body rotates about a\n",
       " <em class=\"emph\">fixed axis</em>. A given point on such a body then moves in a plane\n",
       " perpendicular to this axis. Such rotation of a body about a fixed axis\n",
       " is called <em class=\"emph\">plane rotation</em> or rotation\n",
       " in two dimensions. We shall later generalize the results to three\n",
       " dimensions, but in doing so we shall find that, unlike the case of\n",
       " ordinary particle mechanics, rotations are subtle and hard to understand\n",
       " unless we first get a solid grounding in two dimensions.</p>,\n",
       " <p class=\"p\">The first interesting theorem concerning the motion of complicated\n",
       " objects can be observed at work if we throw an object made of a lot of\n",
       " blocks and spokes, held together by strings, into the air. Of course\n",
       " we know it goes in a parabola, because we studied that for a\n",
       " particle. But now our object is <em class=\"emph\">not</em> a particle; it wobbles and\n",
       " it jiggles, and so on. It does go in a parabola though; one can see\n",
       " that. <em class=\"emph\">What</em> goes in a parabola? Certainly not the point on the\n",
       " corner of the block, because that is jiggling about; neither is it the\n",
       " end of the wooden stick, or the middle of the wooden stick, or the\n",
       " middle of the block. But <em class=\"emph\">something</em> goes in a parabola, there is\n",
       " an effective “center” which moves in a parabola. So our first\n",
       " theorem about complicated objects is to demonstrate that there\n",
       " <em class=\"emph\">is</em> a mean position which is mathematically definable, but not\n",
       " necessarily a point of the material itself, which goes in a\n",
       " parabola. That is called the theorem of the center of the mass, and\n",
       " the proof of it is as follows.</p>,\n",
       " <p class=\"p\">We may consider any object as being made of lots of little particles,\n",
       " the atoms, with various forces among them. Let $i$ represent an index\n",
       " which defines one of the particles. (There are millions of them,\n",
       " so $i$ goes to $10^{23}$, or something.) Then the force on the\n",
       " $i$th particle is, of course, the mass times the acceleration of that\n",
       " particle:\n",
       " \\begin{equation}\n",
       " \\label{Eq:I:18:1}\n",
       " \\FLPF_i=m_i(d^2\\FLPr_i/dt^2).\n",
       " \\end{equation}</p>,\n",
       " <p class=\"p\">In the next few chapters our moving objects will be ones in which all\n",
       " the parts are moving at speeds very much slower than the speed of\n",
       " light, and we shall use the nonrelativistic approximation for all\n",
       " quantities. In these circumstances the mass is constant, so that\n",
       " \\begin{equation}\n",
       " \\label{Eq:I:18:2}\n",
       " \\FLPF_i=d^2(m_i\\FLPr_i)/dt^2.\n",
       " \\end{equation}\n",
       " If we now add the force on all the particles, that is, if we take the\n",
       " sum of all the $\\FLPF_i$’s for all the different indexes, we get the\n",
       " total force, $\\FLPF$. On the other side of the equation, we get the\n",
       " same thing as though we added before the differentiation:\n",
       " \\begin{equation}\n",
       " \\label{Eq:I:18:3}\n",
       " \\sum_i\\FLPF_i=\\FLPF=\\frac{d^2(\\sum_im_i\\FLPr_i)}{dt^2}.\n",
       " \\end{equation}\n",
       " Therefore the total force is the second derivative of the masses times\n",
       " their positions, added together.</p>,\n",
       " <p class=\"p\">Now the total force on all the particles is the same as the\n",
       " <em class=\"emph\">external</em> force. Why? Although there are all kinds of forces on\n",
       " the particles because of the strings, the wigglings, the pullings and\n",
       " pushings, and the atomic forces, and who knows what, and we have to\n",
       " add all these together, we are rescued by Newton’s Third Law. Between\n",
       " any two particles the action and reaction are equal, so that when we\n",
       " add all the equations together, if any two particles have forces\n",
       " between them it cancels out in the sum; therefore the net result is\n",
       " only those forces which arise from other particles which are not\n",
       " included in whatever object we decide to sum over. So if\n",
       " Eq. (<a href=\"#mjx-eqn-EqI183\">18.3</a>) is the sum over a certain number of the particles,\n",
       " which together are called “the object,” then the <em class=\"emph\">external</em> force\n",
       " on the total object is equal to the sum of <em class=\"emph\">all</em> the forces on all\n",
       " its constituent particles.</p>,\n",
       " <p class=\"p\">Now it would be nice if we could write Eq. (<a href=\"#mjx-eqn-EqI183\">18.3</a>) as the\n",
       " total mass times some acceleration. We can. Let us say $M$ is the sum\n",
       " of all the masses, i.e., the total mass. Then if we <em class=\"emph\">define</em> a\n",
       " certain vector $\\FLPR$ to be\n",
       " \\begin{equation}\n",
       " \\label{Eq:I:18:4}\n",
       " \\FLPR=\\sum_im_i\\FLPr_i/M,\n",
       " \\end{equation}\n",
       " Eq. (<a href=\"#mjx-eqn-EqI183\">18.3</a>) will be simply\n",
       " \\begin{equation}\n",
       " \\label{Eq:I:18:5}\n",
       " \\FLPF=d^2(M\\FLPR)/dt^2=M(d^2\\FLPR/dt^2),\n",
       " \\end{equation}\n",
       " since $M$ is a constant. Thus we find that the external force is the\n",
       " total mass times the acceleration of an imaginary point whose location\n",
       " is $\\FLPR$. This point is called the <em class=\"emph\">center of mass</em> of the\n",
       " body. It is a point somewhere in the “middle” of the object, a kind\n",
       " of average $\\FLPr$ in which the different $\\FLPr_i$’s have weights or\n",
       " importances proportional to the masses.</p>,\n",
       " <p class=\"p\">We shall discuss this important theorem in more detail in a later\n",
       " chapter, and we shall therefore limit our remarks to two points: First,\n",
       " if the external forces are zero, if the object were floating in empty\n",
       " space, it might whirl, and jiggle, and twist, and do all kinds of\n",
       " things. But the <em class=\"emph\">center of mass</em>, this artificially invented,\n",
       " calculated position, somewhere in the middle, <em class=\"emph\">will move with a\n",
       " constant velocity</em>. In particular, if it is initially at rest, it will\n",
       " stay at rest. So if we have some kind of a box, perhaps a space ship,\n",
       " with people in it, and we calculate the location of the center of mass\n",
       " and find it is standing still, then the center of mass will continue to\n",
       " stand still if no external forces are acting on the box. Of course, the\n",
       " space ship may move a little in space, but that is because the people\n",
       " are walking back and forth inside; when one walks toward the front, the\n",
       " ship goes toward the back so as to keep the average position of all the\n",
       " masses in exactly the same place.</p>,\n",
       " <p class=\"p\">Is rocket propulsion therefore absolutely impossible because one\n",
       " cannot move the center of mass? No; but of course we find that to\n",
       " propel an interesting part of the rocket, an uninteresting part must\n",
       " be thrown away. In other words, if we start with a rocket at zero\n",
       " velocity and we spit some gas out the back end, then this little blob\n",
       " of gas goes one way as the rocket ship goes the other, but the center\n",
       " of mass is still exactly where it was before. So we simply move the\n",
       " part that we are interested in against the part we are not interested\n",
       " in.</p>,\n",
       " <p class=\"p\">The second point concerning the center of mass, which is the reason we\n",
       " introduced it into our discussion at this time, is that it may be\n",
       " treated separately from the “internal” motions of an object, and may\n",
       " therefore be ignored in our discussion of rotation.</p>,\n",
       " <p class=\"p\">Now let us discuss rotations. Of course an ordinary object does not\n",
       " simply rotate, it wobbles, shakes, and bends, so to simplify matters\n",
       " we shall discuss the motion of a nonexistent ideal object which we\n",
       " call a <em class=\"emph\">rigid body</em>. This means an object in which the forces\n",
       " between the atoms are so strong, and of such character, that the\n",
       " little forces that are needed to move it do not bend it. Its shape\n",
       " stays essentially the same as it moves about. If we wish to study the\n",
       " motion of such a body, and agree to ignore the motion of its center of\n",
       " mass, there is only one thing left for it to do, and that is to\n",
       " <em class=\"emph\">turn</em>. We have to describe that. How? Suppose there is some line\n",
       " in the body which stays put (perhaps it includes the center of mass\n",
       " and perhaps not), and the body is rotating about this particular line\n",
       " as an axis. How do we define the rotation? That is easy enough, for if\n",
       " we mark a point somewhere on the object, anywhere except on the axis,\n",
       " we can always tell exactly where the object is, if we only know where\n",
       " this point has gone to. The only thing needed to describe the position\n",
       " of that point is an <em class=\"emph\">angle</em>. So rotation consists of a study of\n",
       " the variations of the angle with time.</p>,\n",
       " <p class=\"p\">In order to study rotation, we observe the angle through which a body\n",
       " has turned. Of course, we are not referring to any particular angle\n",
       " <em class=\"emph\">inside</em> the object itself; it is not that we draw some angle\n",
       " <em class=\"emph\">on</em> the object. We are talking about the <em class=\"emph\">angular change of\n",
       " the position</em> of the whole thing, from one time to another.</p>,\n",
       " <p class=\"p\">First, let us study the kinematics of rotations. The angle will change\n",
       " with time, and just as we talked about position and velocity in one\n",
       " dimension, we may talk about angular position and angular\n",
       " velocity in plane\n",
       " rotation. In fact, there is a very interesting relationship between\n",
       " rotation in two dimensions and one-dimensional displacement, in which\n",
       " almost every quantity has its analog. First, we have the angle $\\theta$\n",
       " which defines how far the body has gone <em class=\"emph\">around</em>; this replaces the\n",
       " distance $s$, which defines how far it has gone <em class=\"emph\">along</em>. In the\n",
       " same manner, we have a velocity of turning, $\\omega= d\\theta/dt$, which\n",
       " tells us how much the angle changes in a second, just as $v = ds/dt$\n",
       " describes how fast a thing moves, or how far it moves in a second. If\n",
       " the angle is measured in radians, then the angular\n",
       " velocity $\\omega$\n",
       " will be so and so many radians per second. The greater the angular\n",
       " velocity, the\n",
       " faster the object is turning, the faster the angle changes. We can go\n",
       " on: we can differentiate the angular velocity with respect to time, and we\n",
       " can call $\\alpha =$ $d\\omega/dt =$ $d^2\\theta/dt^2$ the angular\n",
       " acceleration. That would be the analog of the ordinary acceleration.\n",
       " </p>,\n",
       " <p class=\"p\">Now of course we shall have to relate the dynamics of rotation to the\n",
       " laws of dynamics of the particles of which the object is made, so we\n",
       " must find out how a particular particle moves when the angular\n",
       " velocity is such and such. To do this, let us take a certain particle\n",
       " which is located at a distance $r$ from the axis and say it is in a\n",
       " certain location $P(x, y)$ at a given instant, in the usual manner\n",
       " (Fig. <a href=\"#Ch18-F1\">18–1</a>). If at a moment $\\Delta t$ later the angle\n",

       " particle is carried with it. It is at the same radius away from $O$ as\n",
       " it was before, but is carried to $Q$. The first thing we would like to\n",
       " know is how much the distance $x$ changes and how much the\n",

       " strange-looking combination of the force and the distance. This\n",
       " “strange combination” is what we call the torque. So, defining the\n",

       " one-dimensional kinematics, where the forces simply add algebraically,\n",

       " It must be emphasized that the torque is about a given axis. If a\n",
       " different axis is chosen, so that all the $x_i$ and $y_i$ are changed,\n",
       " the value of the torque is (usually) changed too.</p>,\n",
       " <p class=\"p\">Now we pause briefly to note that our foregoing introduction of\n",
       " torque, through the idea of work, gives us a most important result for\n",
       " an object in equilibrium: if all the forces on an object are in\n",
       " balance both for translation and rotation, not only is the net\n",
       " <em class=\"emph\">force</em> zero, but the total of all the <em class=\"emph\">torques</em> is also\n",
       " zero, because if an object is in equilibrium, <em class=\"emph\">no work is done by\n",
       " the forces for a small displacement</em>. Therefore, since $\\Delta W =\n",
       " \\tau\\,\\Delta\\theta=0$, the sum of all the torques must be zero. So\n",
       " there are two conditions for equilibrium: that the sum of the forces\n",
       " is zero, and that the sum of the torques is zero. Prove that it\n",
       " suffices to be sure that the sum of torques about any <em class=\"emph\">one</em> axis\n",
       " (in two dimensions) is zero.</p>,\n",
       " <p class=\"p\">Now let us consider a single force, and try to figure out,\n",
       " geometrically, what this strange thing $xF_y - yF_x$ amounts to. In\n",
       " Fig. <a href=\"#Ch18-F2\">18–2</a> we see a force $\\FLPF$ acting at a\n",
       " point $\\FLPr$. When the object has rotated through a small\n",
       " angle $\\Delta\\theta$, the work done, of course, is the component of force in\n",
       " the direction of the displacement times the displacement. In other\n",
       " words, it is only the tangential component of the force that counts,\n",
       " and this must be multiplied by the distance $r\\,\\Delta\\theta$.\n",
       " Therefore we see that the torque is also equal to\n",
       " the tangential component of force (perpendicular to the radius) times\n",
       " the radius. That makes sense in terms of our ordinary idea of the\n",
       " torque, because if the force were completely radial, it would not put\n",
       " any “twist” on the body; it is evident that the twisting effect\n",
       " should involve only the part of the force which is not pulling out\n",
       " from the center, and that means the tangential component. Furthermore,\n",
       " it is clear that a given force is more effective on a long arm than\n",
       " near the axis. In fact, if we take the case where we push right\n",
       " <em class=\"emph\">on</em> the axis, we are not twisting at all!  So it makes sense\n",
       " that the amount of twist, or torque, is proportional both to the\n",
       " radial distance and to the tangential component of the force.</p>,\n",
       " <p class=\"p\">There is still a third formula for the torque which is very\n",
       " interesting. We have just seen that the torque is the force times the\n",
       " radius times the sine of the angle $\\alpha$, in Fig. <a href=\"#Ch18-F2\">18–2</a>.\n",
       " But if we extend the line of action of the force and draw the line $OS$,\n",
       " the perpendicular distance to the line of action of the force (the\n",
       " <em class=\"emph\">lever arm</em> of the force) we notice that this lever arm is shorter\n",
       " than $r$ in just the same proportion as the tangential part of the force\n",
       " is less than the total force. Therefore the formula for the torque can\n",
       " also be written as the magnitude of the force times the length of the\n",
       " lever arm.</p>,\n",
       " <p class=\"p\">The torque is also often called the <em class=\"emph\">moment</em> of the\n",
       " force. The origin of\n",
       " this term is obscure, but it may be related to the fact that “moment”\n",
       " is derived from the Latin <em class=\"emph\">movimentum</em>, and that the capability of\n",
       " a force to move an object (using the force on a lever or crowbar)\n",
       " increases with the length of the lever arm. In mathematics “moment”\n",
       " means weighted by how far away it is from an axis.</p>,\n",
       " <p class=\"p\">Although we have so far considered only the special case of a rigid\n",
       " body, the properties of torques and their mathematical relationships\n",
       " are interesting also even when an object is not rigid. In fact, we can\n",
       " prove a very remarkable theorem: just as external force is the rate of\n",
       " change of a quantity $p$, which we call the total momentum of a\n",
       " collection of particles, so the external torque is the rate of change\n",

       " group of particles.</p>,\n",
       " <p class=\"p\">To prove this, we shall suppose that there is a system of particles on\n",

       " <em class=\"emph\">momentum</em> of an object is the sum of the momenta of all the\n",
       " parts, so the angular momentum is the sum of the angular momenta of\n",

       " Now it might seem that the total torque is a complicated thing. There\n",
